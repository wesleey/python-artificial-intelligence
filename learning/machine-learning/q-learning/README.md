## Q-Learning

This project contains an implementation of the classic game [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) and an AI agent that uses [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) to master the game. Nim is a mathematical game of strategy where players take turns removing objects from piles, and the player forced to take the last object loses. This project includes the game logic, AI training, and an interactive game where a human can play against the AI.
